Projects
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Description:
Predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using the Titanic dataset. This classic beginner project involves training a machine learning model to classify survival status based on passenger attributes.

Features:

Data preprocessing and exploration
Model building with Logistic Regression and Random Forest
Performance evaluation using accuracy and F1-score
Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Vighnesh1045/CODSOFT/titanic-survival-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd titanic-survival-prediction
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script: python predict_survival.py
2. Movie Rating Prediction
Description:
Predict the rating of a movie based on features such as genre, director, and actors. This project involves regression techniques to estimate movie ratings from historical data.

Features:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering
Model building with Linear Regression and Random Forest
Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared
Usage:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Vighnesh1045/CODSOFT/movie-rating-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd movie-rating-prediction
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script: python predict_rating.py
3. Iris Flower Classification
Description:
Classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements. This project is ideal for learning classification techniques with the Iris dataset.

Features:

Data exploration and preprocessing
Classification with Logistic Regression, k-NN, and Decision Trees
Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix
